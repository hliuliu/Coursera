\begin{document}

We know that for any Dyck path from $(0,0)$ to $(2n,0)$ satisfy the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item For each $0\le i\le 2n$, the path passes through $(i,k)$, for some $k\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge0}$, and 
\item if $i<2n$, then the path can next visit $(i+1,k+1)$, or, if $k>0$, $(i+1,k-1)$. We will call these cases ``going up'' and ``going down'', respectively.
\end{itemize}

For $0<j\le 2n$, let the $j$-th symbol of our expression be `(', if the path is going up in the $j$-th iteration, and `)' otherwise. It is easy to see that this forms the required bijection.
